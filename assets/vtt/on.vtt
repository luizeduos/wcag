[Cartoon (feat. Daniel Levi)]

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.000
Hold me close 'til I get up

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:15.000
Time is barely on our side

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't wanna waste what's left

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.000
The storms we chase are leading us

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.000
And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.000
No, I don't want no rest

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:40.000
Echoing around these walls

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:45.000
Fighting to create a song

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't wanna miss a beat

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:55.000
And on and on we'll go

00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:00.000
Through the wastelands, through the highways

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:05.000
To my shadow, through the sunrays

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:10.000
And on and on we'll go

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:15.000
Through the wastelands, through the highways

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:20.000
And on and on we'll go

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:25.000
And we'll grow in number

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.000
Fueled by thunder, see the horizon

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.000
Turn us to thousands

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:40.000
And we'll grow in number

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.000
Fueled by thunder, see the horizon

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:50.000
Turn us to thousands

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:55.000
And on and on we'll go

00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:00.000
Through the wastelands, through the highways

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:05.000
To my shadow, through the sunrays

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:10.000
And on and on we'll go

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:15.000
Through the wastelands, through the highways

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:20.000
And on and on we'll go
